        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Whisk in flour until lightly browned and tender, about 2 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir in 2 cups mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan until well combined. Season with basil, oregano, black pepper; remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 3 lasagna noodles, ricotta, and chicken. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles
            over the chicken and layer with 1/3 of the sauce mixture, spinach, remaining 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Arrange remaining noodles over 
            cheese and spread remaining sauce evenly over noodles. Sprinkle with parsley and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.
